La méthode des points matériels (MPM) fait un usage hybride d'une formulation Lagrangienne et d'une formulation Eulérienne. Ceci lui confère un intérêt majeur pour la modélisation de grandes déformations, en particulier parcequ'aucun remaillage n'est nécessaire.

In the MPM, Lagrangian point masses, or material points, are moved through a Eulerian background mesh. At the end of each calculation cycle, a ‘convective’ step occurs, in which the mesh is reset to its original position, while material points remain in their current positions. There are two key differences between the PIC and MPM. The first one is that the MPM is formulated in the weak form similar to that for the FEM so that the FEM and MPM could be combined together for large-scale simulations. The second one is that history-dependent constitutive models could be formulated on the material points, which results in a robust spatial discretization method for multiphase and multi-physics problems.
